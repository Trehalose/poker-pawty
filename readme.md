# Poker game code test

Fun story, I was sent the code test for this after recently having seen Casino Royale for the first time. The timing couldn't have been more perfect for learning a little bit about poker!

## Requirements

- Node _(If you have version issues, you may need v14)_
- Npm _(If you have version issues, you may need v6)_


## Setting up the project

- Go to the projects root directory via your terminal.
- While still in terminal, run the `npm install .` command.
- Wait for that whole thing to finish.


## Building the project

- Run the `npm run build` command in your terminal.

   - Will set up the JavaScript && CSS files in a `dist` directory.

- Copy the images directory from `./src/imgs/` into the `./dist/` directory to curb any reference errors or missing imagery.


## Using the project

- Go into your project directory
- Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser
- Be wowwed _(Or bow-wowwed, given the project's content)_
